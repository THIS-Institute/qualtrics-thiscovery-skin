# Videos

I haven't finished videos or documentation, but should I win the lottery tomorrow:

Put in a div.thisco-video with a pre or something in it (otherwise it will look blank in Qualtrics)

data-src should be your source (only single at moment)
data-track should be your subtitle track file if you have one (.vtt) (only single at moment)

Optional classes:
- play-once : play only once
- play-only : no video.js controls, just a big play button
- no-pic-in-pic : suppress picture-in-picture, but browsers may well ignore you
- force-fullscreen : play in fullscreen (if using play-only)
