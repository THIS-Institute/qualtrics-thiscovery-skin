This policy explains how The Healthcare Improvement Studies Institute use cookies on [www.thisinstitute.cam.ac.uk](http://www.thisinstitute.cam.ac.uk) and [www.thiscovery.org](https://www.thiscovery.org).

Cookies are small files which sit on your computer and record specific interactions between you and this website, and in some cases, other websites. This information is sometimes shared with the University of Cambridge, and in other cases, third parties. Below is more detail about the cookies we use, what they record and who the information is shared with. You are of course free to disable cookies.

### Functionality lost by disabling cookies or not giving consent

If you disable cookies, or don’t opt in to receive them, some functionality will not be available:

*   PHPSESSID – this cookie stores information about your session and we use it to personalise your experience. We use a cookie as it is more secure than storing this information in the URL. This cookie cannot be accessed by other websites. Disabling it will remove all personalisation.
*   Auth0 – this cookie is necessary to provide the “remember me” function on login to Thiscovery. Disabling it will stop that function from working and will therefore require you to login each time.
