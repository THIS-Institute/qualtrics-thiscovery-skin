----------------------

The following terms apply when you participate in Thiscovery projects.

### Content standards

You agree that you will not submit or upload to the website or publish or store on the website any material or information which you do not own or have rights to use in accordance with these terms and any material or information which is, or may encourage behaviour which is, unlawful (including, without limitation, material or behaviour which is sexually explicit or pornographic; violent or cruel to humans or to animals; hateful or discriminatory; exploitative of minors; or fraudulent, defamatory or in breach of the confidentiality or privacy rights of any person or organisation).

You understand that we may remove any material or information that we consider to be in breach of these terms.

### How we may use your contributions to Thiscovery

In this section, the following definitions apply:

“User Research Input” means all of the input and information that an individual user provides to Thiscovery Projects, via our site, the Cochrane Crowd platform or otherwise, including but not limited to the user’s responses to research questions, research surveys and Thiscovery tasks.

“Research Results” means all knowledge, information, resources and derivative works that we create based on User Research Inputs and our own inputs to Thiscovery Projects. Research Results include collections and amalgamations of User Research Inputs and results, analyses, observations, findings and conclusions derived from or based on these.

Your User Research Input will be considered non-confidential.

You will own your User Research Input and all intellectual property rights of whatever nature throughout the world in and to your User Research Input.

By contributing your User Research Input, you automatically grant to the University of Cambridge a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub-licensable licence to use, create derivative works from, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, distribute and translate your User Research Input, and to include your User Research Input in any products and services or other works in any media now known or later developed.

You hereby waive all moral rights in your User Research Input to which you may not or at any future time be entitled under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 as amended from time to time and under all similar legislation from time to time in force anywhere in the world.

The University of Cambridge will own Research Results and all intellectual property rights of whatever nature throughout the world in and to Research Results, which it may use, distribute or modify in any way.

### Thiscovery projects involving collaborating organisations

For Thiscovery Projects that are based on users performing tasks for systematic reviews of the literature, we are collaborating with The Cochrane Collaborative (“Cochrane”) to enable User Research Input to be submitted through the Cochrane Crowd platform. This will require the sharing of certain of your personal information with Cochrane and Cochrane’s contracted service providers for the specific purpose of managing the secure interface between Thiscovery.org and the Cochrane Crowd platform, and for no other purpose. Such transfer will be governed by legal agreements between the University of Cambridge and Cochrane to ensure that your personal information is kept confidential and used lawfully, so that your rights under all applicable laws and statutes (including the Common Law of Confidentiality, the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2018 and the UK Data Protection Act 2018) are protected. By signing up to take part in projects of this type, you will automatically grant us permission to transfer certain of your personal and confidential information to Cochrane, subject to the conditions described in this paragraph.
